/// A running process of a binary.
///
/// All `tracing` events emitted by your binary in JSON over stdout will be processed by `BinProcess` and then emitted to the tests stdout in the default human readable tracing format.
/// To ensure any WARN/ERROR's from your test logic are visible, `BinProcess` will setup its own subscriber that outputs to the tests stdout in the default human readable format.
/// If you set your own subscriber before constructing a [`BinProcess`] that will take preference instead.
///
/// Dropping the BinProcess will trigger a panic unless [`BinProcess::shutdown_and_then_consume_events`] or [`BinProcess::consume_remaining_events`] has been called.
/// This is done to avoid missing important assertions run by those methods.
///
/// ## Which constructor to use:
/// A guide to constructing `BinProcess` based on your use case:
///
/// ### You are writing an integration test or bench and the binary you want to run is defined in the same package as the test or bench you are writing.
///
/// Use [`BinProcess::start_binary`] like this:
/// ```rust
/// # use tokio_bin_process::BinProcess;
/// # // hack to make the doc test compile
/// # macro_rules! bin_path {
/// #     ($bin_name:expr) => {
/// #         &std::path::Path::new("foo")
/// #     };
/// # }
/// # async {
/// BinProcess::start_binary(
///     bin_path!("cooldb"),
///     "cooldb",
///     &["--log-format", "json"],
/// ).await;
/// # };
/// ```
/// Using `start_binary` instead of `start_crate_name` here is faster and more robust as `BinProcess` does not need to invoke Cargo.
///
/// ### You are writing an integration test or bench and the binary you want to test is in the same workspace but in a different package to the test or bench you are writing.
/// Use [`BinProcess::start_crate_name`] like this:
/// ```rust
/// # use tokio_bin_process::BinProcess;
/// # async {
/// BinProcess::start_crate_name(
///     "cooldb",
///     "cooldb",
///     &["--log-format", "json"],
///     None
/// ).await;
/// # };
/// ```
///
/// ### You are writing an example or other binary within a package
/// Use [`BinProcess::start_crate_name`] like this:
/// ```rust
/// # use tokio_bin_process::BinProcess;
/// # async {
/// BinProcess::start_crate_name(
///     "cooldb",
///     "cooldb",
///     &["--log-format", "json"],
///     None
/// ).await;
/// # };
/// ```
///
/// ### You need to compile the binary with an arbitrary profile
/// Use [`BinProcess::start_crate_name`] like this:
/// ```rust
/// # use tokio_bin_process::BinProcess;
/// # async {
/// BinProcess::start_crate_name(
///     "cooldb",
///     "cooldb",
///     &["--log-format", "json"],
///     Some("profilename")
/// ).await;

/// # async {
